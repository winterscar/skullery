# skullery

Skullery is a Recipe app that has a *database* of ingredients rather than free text.

This enables many cool features:

- Proper shopping list generation (with categorisation, aggregation, etcâ€¦)
- Consistent scaling and adjustment options
- Unit swapping on-the-fly
- Ingredient alternatives suggestions

Other useful features:

- Measure time of each step to calculate recipe total time
- Sub-recipes
- What can I make with these ingredients?

## Getting Started

1. Start the application: `lein run`
2. Go to [localhost:8888/ide](http://localhost:8888/ide) to see the graphql ide
